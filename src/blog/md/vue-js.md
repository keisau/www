## Boring job, so far

What could be more serious than wasting time sitting in office? Ugh, I can't stand it. So I started revamping my blog with [Vue.js](//vuejs.org). This one is real cool and solid!

For the code, checkout [this](//github.com/pierresaux/blog).

## Stack

1. Vue.js
2. Vue Router
3. Prerender SPA Plugin for Webpack
4. Babel (ES2015 - ES2016)
5. Webpack 2
6. Pug
7. SCSS
8. PostCSS

and more...I will try to consolidate the site source code and minimize dependencies.

## Dropped Stack

Something have been dropped for simplicity.

1. CloudFront
2. Bootstrap

If you feel lost with Vue.js stack, this site may be useful.
