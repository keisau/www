It's been a long time since I last updated my homepage.

This time, nothing special, just making it better and better.

And of course, upgrade packages to the latest version, hoping to learn more and keep myself updated. Only a dead man has no need of learning and changes. Of course, I don't think there is a framework or statis site generator that suits my needs.

Just started a new job. Now I have to wake up a lot earlier. Hope everything will be fine!

When I have time, I will discuss this site a little bit and add more contents to it.
